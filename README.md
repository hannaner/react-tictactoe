## Tic Tac Toe
Refreshing React knowledge by following along React's Tic-Tac-Toe example here: [Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

## How to get started
:construction: Currently WIP! :construction:

## Next steps
Here are next versions. This is a list taken from the React Tutorial.
* For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
* Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
